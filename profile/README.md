# Torizon #

[Torizon](https://www.torizon.io/) is an Easy-to-Use Industrial Linux Platform. It consists of:

- [Torizon OS]: the base Embedded Linux distribution that actually runs on your preferred hardware.
- [Torizon Cloud]: a platform to manage services like remote access, updates, and monitoring via an API or a web GUI.
- [Debian Containers for Torizon]: smooth integration of a robust, widely used Linux distro, on top of the Torizon OS.
- [VS Code IDE Extension]: the preferred application development workflow, with a ready-to-use SDK for various languages and frameworks, leveraging the Torizon OS and Debian Containers.
- [TorizonCore Builder]: a configuration tool so Torizon OS runs on your custom carrier board.
